title: "Degradation Alignment in Remaining Useful Life Prediction Using Deep Cycle-Consistent Learning"
excerpt: "Due to the benefits of reduced maintenance cost and increased operational safety, effective prognostic methods have always been highly demanded in real industries. In the recent years, intelligent data-driven remaining useful life (RUL) prediction approaches have been successfully developed and achieved promising performance."

  - title: "Deep learning early stopping for non-degenerate ghost imaging"
    excerpt: "Quantum ghost imaging offers many advantages over classical imaging, including the ability to probe an object with one wavelength and record the image with another (non-degenerate ghost imaging), but suffers from slow image reconstruction due to sparsity and probabilistic arrival positions of photons."

  - title: "Dynamic PET Image Denoising Using Deep Image Prior Combined With Regularization by Denoising"
    excerpt: "The quantitative accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) is affected by several factors, including the intrinsic resolution of the imaging system and inherently noisy data, which result in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of PET image."
