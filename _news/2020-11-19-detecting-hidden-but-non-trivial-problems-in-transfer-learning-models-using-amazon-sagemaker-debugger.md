title: "Detecting hidden but non-trivial problems in transfer learning models using Amazon SageMaker Debugger"
excerpt: "Rapid development of deep learning technology has produced an abundance of open-sourced, pre-trained models in computer vision and natural language processing. As a result, transfer learning has become a popular approach in deep learning. Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model"
