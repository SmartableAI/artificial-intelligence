{"path":"_projects/apache-mxnet.md","title":null,"excerpt":"Apache MXNet (incubating) is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility. It allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity. At its core, MXNet contains a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. MXNet is portable and lightweight, scaling effectively to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.","sourceUrl":"https://smartableai.github.io/artificial-intelligence/api/projects/apache-mxnet/index.json","webUrl":"https://smartable.ai/apps/ai/project/apache-mxnet/","originalUrl":null,"actions":null,"github":{"url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet","watches":1200,"stars":18100,"forks":6400,"languages":["Python","C++"]},"provider":{"name":"Apache","domain":"apache.org","images":[{"url":"https://smartableai.github.io/artificial-intelligence/assets/images/organizations/apache.org-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":null},"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":757,"tags":["Deep Learning"],"images":[{"url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/web-data/master/mxnet/image/mxnet_logo_2.png","width":500,"height":171,"title":"logo","attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"content":"","name":"Apache MXNet","type":"code","topics":["AI","Machine Learning"]}
