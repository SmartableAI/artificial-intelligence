title: "Solving 'barren plateaus' is the key to quantum machine learning"
excerpt: "Many machine learning algorithms on quantum computers suffer from the dreaded \"barren plateau\" of unsolvability, where they run into dead ends on optimization problems. This challenge had been relatively unstudiedâ€”until now."

  - title: "Solving 'barren plateaus' is the key to quantum machine learning (image)"
    excerpt: "A barren plateau is a trainability problem that occurs in machine learning optimization algorithms when the problem-solving space turns flat as the algorithm is run. Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed theorems to prove that any given algorithm will avoid a barren plateau as it scales up to run on a quantum computer."
