title: "RoboGrammar System Automates and Optimizes Robot Design"
excerpt: "The shape of a robot determines what types of tasks it can perform and environment it can operate in. With current technological limitations, there is no way to build and test each form, but a new system developed by researchers at MIT allows for these many forms to be simulated."
