title: "Intel is using AI to gather real-time data on coral reef health"
excerpt: "Project CORaiL monitors prosthetic reefs with AI-powered video cameras. There’s no question that coral reefs are rapidly deteriorating due to overfishing, bottom trawling, warming temperatures and unsustainable coastal development. In order to help protect and restore reefs, scientists need more data, and Intel thinks it might have a solution."
