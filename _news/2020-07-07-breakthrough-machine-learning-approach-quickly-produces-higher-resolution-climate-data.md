title: "Breakthrough machine learning approach quickly produces higher-resolution climate data"
excerpt: "National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have developed a novel machine learning approach to quickly enhance the resolution of wind velocity data by 50 times and solar irradiance data by 25 times--an enhancement that has never been achieved before with climate data."

  - title: "Stable machine-learning parameterization of subgrid processes for climate modeling at a range of resolutions"
    excerpt: "Machine learning has been used to represent small-scale processes, such as clouds, in atmospheric models but this can lead to instability in simulations of climate. Here, the authors demonstrate a use of machine learning in an atmospheric model that leads to stable simulations of climate at a range of grid spacings."
