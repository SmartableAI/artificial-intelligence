title: "Don't trust deep-learning algos to touch up medical scans: Boffins warn 'highly unstable' tech leads to bad diagnoses"
excerpt: "We love Microsoft most Be wary of medical scans enhanced by AI algorithms: the software is prone to making tiny errors that could lead to incorrect diagnoses, a study has warned. Some scientists argue that deep-learning code could reduce the time spent conducting medical scans if the algorithms can automatically improve image quality for medics and computer programs to assess."
