title: "Skoltech scientists use machine learning to help doctors find veins for no-fuss blood draws"
excerpt: "Researchers from Skoltech have developed an early prototype of a medical imaging system that uses neural networks to analyze near-infrared images of veins and project a venous pattern onto a patient's body - this may make blood draws much easier and less of a nuisance for patients with difficult access to veins."

    excerpt: "Researchers in Russia have developed a prototype of a medical imaging system that uses neural networks to analyse near-infrared images of veins and project a venous pattern onto a patient’s body. The system could help make blood draws much easier and less of a nuisance for patients with difficult access to veins."
