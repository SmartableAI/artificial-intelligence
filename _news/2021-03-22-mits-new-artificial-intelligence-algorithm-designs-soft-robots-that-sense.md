  - title: "Deep-learning algorithm designs soft robots with sensors"
    excerpt: "Creating soft robots has been a long-running challenge in robotics. Their rigid counterparts have a built-in advantage: a limited range of motion. Rigid robots' finite array of joints and limbs usually makes for manageable calculations by the algorithms that control mapping and motion planning."
