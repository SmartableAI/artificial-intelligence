title: "First online CES tech event lures fewer Chinese participants"
excerpt: "The first online-only CES will kick off on Monday, with tech executives and industry experts participating remotely from around the world, instead of shaking hands in Las Vegas. The annual four-day conference -- formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show -- will enter its 54th year with no physical presence due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
