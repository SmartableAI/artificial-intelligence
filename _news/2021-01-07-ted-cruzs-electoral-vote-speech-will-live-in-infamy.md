excerpt: "In 2016, he gave it a shot — only to see Donald Trump emerge from the world of celebrity to more effectively speak to Cruz’s intended voters. Cruz was at a disadvantage, to be fair; he was still bound to at least some degree by his constituents and by some sense of what was and wasn’t acceptable in politics."
