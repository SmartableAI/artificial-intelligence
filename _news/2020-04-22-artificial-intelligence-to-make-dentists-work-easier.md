  - title: "Deep learning model can make dentists' work easier"
    excerpt: "The model is based on a fully convolutional architecture, which makes it as fast and data-efficient as possible. Based on the research results, this type of a deep learning model can localize the mandibular canals highly accurately. It surpasses the statistical shape models, which have thus far been the best, automatized method to localize the ..."

  - title: "AI to make dentists' work easier"
    excerpt: "In order to plan a dental implant operation and the implant size and position, dentists need to know the exact location of the mandibular canal, a canal located in both sides of the lower jaw that contains the alveolar nerve. The lower jaw is an anatomically complex structure and medical experts use X-ray and computer tomography (CT) models to ..."
