title: "Stanford researchers combine processors and memory on multiple hybrid chips to run AI on battery-powered smart devices"
excerpt: "In traditional electronics, separate chips process and store data, wasting energy as they toss data back and forth over what engineers call a “memory wall.” New algorithms combine several energy-efficient hybrid chips to create the illusion of one mega–AI chip."
