title: "A comparative analysis of artificial neural networks and wavelet hybrid approaches to long-term toxic heavy metal prediction"
excerpt: "The occurrence of toxic metals in the aquatic environment is as caused by a variety of contaminations which makes difficulty in the concentration prediction. In this study, conventional methods of back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) were applied as benchmark models."
