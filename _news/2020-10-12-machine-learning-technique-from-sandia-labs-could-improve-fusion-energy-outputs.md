title: "Machine-learning technique from Sandia Labs could improve fusion energy outputs"
excerpt: "Machine learning techniques are being used to improve simulations of the reactor's wall material as it interacts with plasma. This has been beyond he scope of atomic-scale simulations of the past.The expected result should suggest procedural or structural modifications to improve nuclear energy output."
