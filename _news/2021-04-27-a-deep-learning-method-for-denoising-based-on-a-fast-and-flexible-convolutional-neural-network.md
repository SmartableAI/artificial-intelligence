  - title: "A novel algorithm to detect non-wear time from raw accelerometer data using deep convolutional neural networks"
    excerpt: "All models were trained on 2 Ã— Nvidia RTX 2080TI graphics cards and programmed in the Python library TensorFlow (v2.0) 36. At this stage, the trained CNN model can only classify the start and stop windows of a candidate non-wear episode. To fully detect ..."
