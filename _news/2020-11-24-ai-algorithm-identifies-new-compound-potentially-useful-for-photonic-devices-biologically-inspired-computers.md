title: "AI algorithm identifies new compound potentially useful for photonic devices, biologically inspired computers"
excerpt: "When the words \"artificial intelligence\" (AI) come to mind, your first thoughts may be of super-smart computers, or robots that perform tasks without needing any help from humans. Now, a multi-institutional team including researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has accomplished something not too far off: They developed an AI algorithm called CAMEO that discovered a potentially useful new material without requiring additional training from scientists."
