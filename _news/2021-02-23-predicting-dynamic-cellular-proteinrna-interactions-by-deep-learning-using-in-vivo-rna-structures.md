title: "Predicting dynamic cellular protein–RNA interactions by deep learning using in vivo RNA structures"
excerpt: "Interactions with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are integral to RNA function and cellular regulation, and dynamically reflect specific cellular conditions. However, presently available tools for predicting RBP–RNA interactions employ RNA sequence and/or predicted RNA structures,"

  - title: "Machine learning aids in simulating dynamics of interacting atoms"
    excerpt: "A revolutionary machine-learning (ML) approach to simulate the motions of atoms in materials such as aluminum is described in this week's Nature Communications journal. This automated approach to \"interatomic potential development\" could transform the field of computational materials discovery."
