      "excerpt": "After a baby is born, doctors sometimes examine the placenta for features that indicate health risks in any future pregnancies. Most placentas go unexamined after the birth. A team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) report the development of a machine learning approach to examine placenta slides in The American Journal of Pathology so more women can be informed of their health risks.",
