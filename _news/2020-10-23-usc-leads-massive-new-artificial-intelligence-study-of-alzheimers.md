    excerpt: "IBM (IBM +0.4%) and Pfizer (PFE +1.0%) have published research in The Lancet eClinicalMedicine outlining the duo's AI-backed approach to diagnosing Alzheimer's years before symptoms occur.The researches developed an AI model that uses samples of language data (obtained from clinical cognitive verbal tests) to predict with 71% accuracy the eventual onset of the disease within seemingly healthy people who don't have any Alzheimer's risk factors."
