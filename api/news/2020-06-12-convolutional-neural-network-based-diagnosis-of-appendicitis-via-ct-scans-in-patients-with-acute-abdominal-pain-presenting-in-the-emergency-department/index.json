We investigated the feasibility of a neural-network-based diagnosis algorithm of appendicitis by using computed tomography (CT) for patients with acute abdominal pain visiting the emergency room (ER).","sourceUrl":"https://smartableai.github.io/artificial-intelligence/api/news/2020-06-12-convolutional-neural-network-based-diagnosis-of-appendicitis-via-ct-scans-in-patients-with-acute-abdominal-pain-presenting-in-the-emergency-department/index.json","webUrl":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66674-7","originalUrl":null,"featuredContent":null,"heat":null,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-020-66674-7/MediaObjects/41598_2020_66674_Fig1_HTML.png","width":685,"height":396,"title":"Convolutional-neural-network-based diagnosis of appendicitis via CT scans in patients with acute abdominal pain presenting in the emergency department","attribution":null,"isCached":true}],"type":"article","ampWebUrl":null,"cdnAmpWebUrl":null,"publishedDateTime":"2020-06-12T02:28:00-07:00","updatedDateTime":null,"provider":{"name":"Nature","domain":"nature.com","images":null,"publishers":null,"authors":null},"locale":"en-us","categories":["news"],"topics":["Machine Learning","AI"]}
