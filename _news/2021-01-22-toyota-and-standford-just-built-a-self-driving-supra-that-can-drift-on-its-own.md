title: "Toyota and Standford Just Built a Self-Driving Supra That Can Drift on Its Own"
excerpt: "As far-fetched as that may sound, researchers at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) and Stanford University’s Dynamic Design Lab have built a self-driving Supra that can do just that. Of course, the vehicle isn’t just an experiment in doing cool things—even though that’s just what this is—it’s part of a broader attempt to make the roads safer going forward."
