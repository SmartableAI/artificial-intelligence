title: "This self-driving robot tank can parachute out of a plane"
excerpt: "Every tank is a fortress in danger of becoming a coffin. Their heavy armor and ample firepower make them special targets for hostile forces equipped with powerful and portable anti-tank weapons. The Type-X uncrewed vehicle is an Estonian-made answer to future battlefields that want the punch of tanks without the risk to human crew."
