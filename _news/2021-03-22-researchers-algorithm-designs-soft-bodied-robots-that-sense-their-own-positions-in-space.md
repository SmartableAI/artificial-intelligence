title: "Researchers' algorithm designs soft-bodied robots that sense their own positions in space"
excerpt: "There are some tasks that traditional robots—the rigid and metallic kind—simply aren't cut out for. Soft-bodied robots, on the other hand, may be able to interact with people more safely or slip into tight spaces with ease."
