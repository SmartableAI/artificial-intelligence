title: "Sleep is also essential for artificial brains, shows study"
excerpt: "No one can say whether androids will dream of electric sheep, but they will almost certainly need periods of rest that offer benefits similar to those that sleep provides to living brains, according to new research from Los Alamos National Laboratory."

    excerpt: "Artificial intelligence designed to function like a human could require periods of rest similar to those needed by biological brains. Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US discovered that neural networks experienced benefits that were \"the equivalent of a good night's rest\" when exposed to an artificial analogue of sleep."

  - title: "Artificial brains may need sleep too"
    excerpt: "Neural networks that become unstable after continuous periods of self-learning will return to stability after exposed to sleep like states, according to a study of simulated spiking neural networks, suggesting that even artificial brains need to nap occasionally."

    excerpt: "Attempts to build neural networks similar in capacity to the human brain have found that periods of sleep help quell instability. Researchers’ efforts to build artificial brains using powerful neural networks have discovered a potential mirroring of humanity in their systems. A team from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US led by ..."

    excerpt: "We study spiking neural networks, which are systems that learn much as living brains do,” LANL computer scientist Yijing Watkins said. “We were fascinated by the prospect of training a neuromorphic processor in a manner analogous to how humans and other biological systems learn from their environment during childhood development."
