title: "Machine learning could help find veins for easier blood draws"
excerpt: "Researchers in Russia have developed a prototype of a medical imaging system that uses neural networks to analyse near-infrared images of veins and project a venous pattern onto a patient’s body. The system could help make blood draws much easier and less of a nuisance for patients with difficult access to veins."
