title: "Deep learning for high-resolution and high-sensitivity interferometric phase contrast imaging"
excerpt: "Lau interferometry, the sample position yielding the highest phase sensitivity suffers from strong geometric blur. This trade-off between phase-sensitivity and spatial resolution is a fundamental challenge in such interferometric imaging applications with either neutron or conventional x-ray sources due to their relatively large beam-defining apertures or focal spots."
