    excerpt: "Since its first outbreak, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading worldwide and caused a global pandemic. Rapid and early detection is essential to contain COVID-19. Here, we first developed a deep learning (DL) integrated radiomics model for end-to-end identification of COVID-19 using CT scans and then validated its clinical feasibility."
