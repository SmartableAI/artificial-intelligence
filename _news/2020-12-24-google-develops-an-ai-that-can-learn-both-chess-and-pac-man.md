title: "Google develops an AI that can learn both chess and Pac-Man"
excerpt: "We've developed AIs that can tackle these games, too, but they have had to take a very different approach to the ones that conquered chess and Go. At least until now.

    excerpt: "Watch the two simulated robots above, and you’ll notice a big difference. Even though both of their “brains” have evolved over 300 generations to allow them to walk, only one succeeds; the other falls flat on its back."
