title: "Multimodal deep learning approach for event detection in sports using Amazon SageMaker"
excerpt: "Have you ever thought about how artificial intelligence could be used to detect events during live sports broadcasts? With machine learning (ML) techniques, we introduce a scalable multimodal solution for event detection on sports video data. Recent developments in deep learning show that event detection"
