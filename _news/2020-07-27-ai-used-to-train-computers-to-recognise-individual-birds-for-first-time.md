  - title: "AI software which recognises individual birds could boost conservation efforts, researchers say"
    excerpt: "Birds could be spared the stressful process of identification tagging after researchers developed facial recognition software which can recognise individual birds, something humans are unable to do.|  Individual recognition of animals is one of the most expensive and time-consuming problems in research,"
