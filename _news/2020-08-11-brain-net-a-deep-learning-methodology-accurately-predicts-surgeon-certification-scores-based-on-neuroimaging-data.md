  - title: "Classification of femur fracture in pelvic X-ray images using meta-learned deep neural network"
    excerpt: "However, different forms of fracture exist, and inaccurate results have been confirmed depending on condition at the time of imaging, which is problematic. To overcome this limitation, we present an encoder-decoder structured neural network that utilizes radiology reports as ancillary information at training."
