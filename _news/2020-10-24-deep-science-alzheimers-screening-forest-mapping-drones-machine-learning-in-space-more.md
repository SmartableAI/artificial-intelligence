  - title: "The AI that spots Alzheimer's from cookie drawing"
    excerpt: "A dated line drawing of two children stealing cookies behind their mother's back is being used by an artificial intelligence system to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The system uses voice samples of people describing the scene to predict whether healthy people may get the disease."
