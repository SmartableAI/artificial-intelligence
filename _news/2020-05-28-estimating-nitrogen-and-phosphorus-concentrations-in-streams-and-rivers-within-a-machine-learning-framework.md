title: "Estimating nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in streams and rivers, within a machine learning framework"
excerpt: "Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) are essential nutritional elements for life processes in water bodies. However, in excessive quantities, they may represent a significant source of aquatic pollution. Eutrophication has become a widespread issue rising from a chemical nutrient imbalance and is largely attributed to anthropogenic activities."
