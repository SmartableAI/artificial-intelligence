title: "Discovering microbe-disease associations from the literature using a hierarchical long short-term memory network and an ensemble parser model"
excerpt: "Even though a tremendous number of studies describing the association between microbes and diseases have been published, text mining methods that focus on such associations have been rarely studied. We propose a framework that combines machine learning and natural language processing methods to analyze the association between microbes and diseases."
