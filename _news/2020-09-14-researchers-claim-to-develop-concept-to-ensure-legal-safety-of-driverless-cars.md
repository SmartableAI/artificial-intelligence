title: "Researchers claim to develop concept to ensure ‘legal safety’ of driverless cars"
excerpt: "The algorithm attempts to verify that a driverless car will maintain “fail-safe trajectories at all times”, meaning they move at a speed and direction allowing them to avoid collisions with other vehicles being driven legally."

    excerpt: "And since such situations are so rare, De Freitas and colleagues argue, there’s really no need to expend so much effort on trying to figure out how we can program our driverless cars to make the right moral decisions in these hypothetical cases."
