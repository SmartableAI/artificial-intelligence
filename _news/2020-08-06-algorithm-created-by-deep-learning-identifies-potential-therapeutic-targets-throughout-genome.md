title: "Algorithm Created By \"Deep Learning\" Identifies Potential Therapeutic Targets Throughout Genome"
excerpt: "A team of researchers from New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) have developed an algorithm through machine learning that helps predict sites of DNA methylation – a process that can change the activity of DNA without changing its overall structure – and could identify disease-causing mechanisms that would otherwise be missed by conventional screening methods."
