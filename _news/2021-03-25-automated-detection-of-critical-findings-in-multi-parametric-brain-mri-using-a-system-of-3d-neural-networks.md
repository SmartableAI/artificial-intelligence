title: "Automated detection of critical findings in multi-parametric brain MRI using a system of 3D neural networks"
excerpt: "With the rapid growth and increasing use of brain MRI, there is an interest in automated image classification to aid human interpretation and improve workflow. We aimed to train a deep convolutional neural network and assess its performance in identifying abnormal brain MRIs and critical intracranial findings including acute infarction,"
