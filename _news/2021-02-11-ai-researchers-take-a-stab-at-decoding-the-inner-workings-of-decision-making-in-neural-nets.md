title: "AI Researchers Take a Stab at Decoding the Inner Workings of Decision-Making in Neural Nets"
excerpt: "Scientists introduce a new method to teach DNA patterns to a convolutional neural network that allows it to build on the data to identify more complex patterns. This discovery makes it possible to peek inside the black box and identify some key features that lead to the neural netâ€™s decision-making process."

  - title: "AI researchers ask: What's going on inside the black box?"
    excerpt: "Brain-like artificial networks are often referred to as a 'black box' because researchers do not know how they learn and make predictions. Researchers reported a way to peek inside the box and identify key features on which the computer relies,"
