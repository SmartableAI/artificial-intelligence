  - title: "Artificial Intelligence Aids UCSD Gene Activation Discovery"
    excerpt: "With the help of artificial intelligence, the UCSD researchers say they have identified a DNA activation code that's used at least as frequently as the TATA box in humans. The discovery, which they named the downstream core promoter region — or DPR — opens up possibilities for another major portion of our genes."
