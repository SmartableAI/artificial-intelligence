  - title: "AI: MIT scientists develop a new ‘liquid’ neural network – ‘future of robot control’"
    excerpt: "MIT scientists have developed a type of neural network that learns on the job, not just during its training phase. These flexible algorithms, dubbed “liquid” networks, change their underlying equations to continuously adapt to new data inputs."
