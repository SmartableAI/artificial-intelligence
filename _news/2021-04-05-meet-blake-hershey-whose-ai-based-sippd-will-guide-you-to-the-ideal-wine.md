title: "Meet Blake Hershey, whose AI-based Sippd will guide you to the ideal wine"
excerpt: "Blake Hershey is co-founder and CEO of Sippd, a D.C. company whose mobile app and marketplace uses artificial intelligence to guide its users to wines that match their tastes. What inspired Sippd? The idea for Sippd came from a simple statement my fiancé made after returning from a weekend trip with her girlfriends: “I wish there was an app that would tell me which wines I’ll like on a wine list."
