  - title: "Artificial Intelligence has learned to estimate oil viscosity"
    excerpt: "A group of Skoltech scientists have developed machine learning (ML) algorithms that can teach artificial intelligence (AI) to determine oil viscosity based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data. The new method can come in handy for the petroleum industry and other sectors that have to rely on indirect measurements to characterize a substance."
