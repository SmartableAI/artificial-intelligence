title: "Amazon SageMaker Neo makes it easier to get faster inference for more ML models with NVIDIA TensorRT"
excerpt: "Amazon SageMaker Neo now uses the NVIDIA TensorRT acceleration library to increase the speedup of machine learning (ML) models on NVIDIA Jetson devices at the edge and AWS g4dn and p3 instances in the AWS Cloud. Neo compiles models from TensorFlow, TFLite, MXNet, PyTorch, ONNX, and DarkNet to make optimal"
