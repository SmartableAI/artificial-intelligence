title: "Finding key players in complex networks through deep reinforcement learning"
excerpt: "A fundamental problem in network science is how to find an optimal set of key players whose activation or removal significantly impacts network functionality. The authors propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that can be trained on small networks to understand the organizing principles of complex networked systems."
