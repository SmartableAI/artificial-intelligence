title: "Future of compute will be big, small, smart and way out on the edge"
excerpt: "Predicting the future of compute is a little like forecasting an afternoon of high winds and rain on a calm, cloudless morning. It may not seem obvious, but change is coming. It always does. What change will look like for the computing world depends on how the strategies being put in place now by major cloud providers and an expanding ecosystem of technology firms become more widely adopted by enterprises at scale."
