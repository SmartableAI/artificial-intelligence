title: "Machine learning helps predict survival rates of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest"
excerpt: "Machine learning predictions about the survival rate of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were more accurate when neighborhood-level factors were added to the data analysis. Future research can use this newly developed model to identify neighborhood-level intervention methods to decrease death rates from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest."
