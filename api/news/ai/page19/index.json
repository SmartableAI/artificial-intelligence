      "excerpt": "Students at Cranfield University have designed computer models that can identify COVID-19 in X-rays. The models use computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze chest X-ray imagery. It can classify information which would not normally be recognized with the naked eye and assist with the diagnosis of COVID-19.",
