  - title: "Learning excited states from ground states by using an artificial neural network"
    excerpt: "Excited states are different quantum states from their ground states, and spectroscopy methods that can assess excited states are widely used in materials characterization. Understanding the spectra reflecting excited states is thus of great importance for materials science."
