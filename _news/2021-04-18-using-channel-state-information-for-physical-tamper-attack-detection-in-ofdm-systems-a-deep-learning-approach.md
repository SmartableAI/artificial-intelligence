title: "Using Channel State Information for Physical Tamper Attack Detection in OFDM Systems: A Deep Learning Approach"
excerpt: "This letter proposes a deep learning approach to detect a change in the antenna orientation of transmitter or receiver as a physical tamper attack in OFDM systems using channel state information. We treat the physical tamper attack problem as a semi-supervised anomaly detection problem and utilize a deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) to tackle it."
