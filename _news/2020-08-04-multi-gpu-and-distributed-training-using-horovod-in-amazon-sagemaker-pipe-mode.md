title: "Multi-GPU and distributed training using Horovod in Amazon SageMaker Pipe mode"
excerpt: "There are many techniques to train deep learning models with a small amount of data. Examples include transfer learning, few-shot learning, or even one-shot learning for an image classification task and fine-tuning for language models based on a pre-trained BERT or GPT2 model. However, you may still"
