title: "Panasonic’s new vlogging camera uses facial recognition tracking to isolate the sound of your voice"
excerpt: "When shooting in 4K, however, the camera can’t utilize the entire sensor. Instead, it shoots from a smaller cropped area in the center. This makes lenses appear more zoomed-in than they would if they were using the whole sensor."
