  - title: "RNA secondary structure prediction using deep learning with thermodynamic integration"
    excerpt: "Accurately predicting the secondary structure of non-coding RNAs can help unravel their function. Here the authors propose a method integrating thermodynamic information and deep learning to improve the robustness of RNA secondary structure prediction compared to several existing algorithms."
