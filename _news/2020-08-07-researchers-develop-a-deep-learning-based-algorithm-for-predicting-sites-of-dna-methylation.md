title: "Researchers develop a deep learning-based algorithm for predicting sites of DNA methylation"
excerpt: "A team of researchers from New Jersey Institute of Technology and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia have developed an algorithm through machine learning that helps predict sites of DNA methylation - a process that can change the activity of DNA without changing its overall structure - and could identify disease-causing mechanisms that would otherwise be missed by conventional screening methods."
