title: "Prediction of slope failure in open-pit mines using a novel hybrid artificial intelligence model based on decision tree and evolution algorithm"
excerpt: "In this study, the objective was to develop a new and highly-accurate artificial intelligence model for slope failure prediction in open-pit mines. For this purpose, the M5Rules algorithm was combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) in a novel hybrid technique,"
