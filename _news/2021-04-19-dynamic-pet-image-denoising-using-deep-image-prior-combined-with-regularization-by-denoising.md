title: "Dynamic PET Image Denoising Using Deep Image Prior Combined With Regularization by Denoising"
excerpt: "The quantitative accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) is affected by several factors, including the intrinsic resolution of the imaging system and inherently noisy data, which result in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of PET image."
