excerpt: "The former Saab plant in Trollh√§ttan, Sweden, hasn't built a car since 2013, but it could be up and running again if current owner NEVS finds success with its new Sango self-driving car. The Sango is a six-seat shuttle that NEVS plans to operate on a trial basis in the Swedish capital Stockholm starting in late 2021."
