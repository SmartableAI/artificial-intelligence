title: "Deep learning early stopping for non-degenerate ghost imaging"
excerpt: "Quantum ghost imaging offers many advantages over classical imaging, including the ability to probe an object with one wavelength and record the image with another (non-degenerate ghost imaging), but suffers from slow image reconstruction due to sparsity and probabilistic arrival positions of photons."

  - title: "Dynamic PET Image Denoising Using Deep Image Prior Combined With Regularization by Denoising"
    excerpt: "The quantitative accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) is affected by several factors, including the intrinsic resolution of the imaging system and inherently noisy data, which result in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of PET image."
