title: "Experimental Demonstration of Supervised Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with Phase-Change Memory Synapses"
excerpt: "Spiking neural networks (SNN) are computational models inspired by the brainâ€™s ability to naturally encode and process information in the time domain. The added temporal dimension is believed to render them more computationally efficient than the conventional artificial neural networks,"
