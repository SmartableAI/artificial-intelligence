title: "Deep Learning-Based Short-Term Load Forecasting Approach in Smart Grid With Clustering and Consumption Pattern Recognition"
excerpt: "Different aggregation levels of the electric gridâ€™s big data can be helpful to develop highly accurate deep learning models for Short-term Load Forecasting (STLF) in electrical networks. Whilst different models are proposed for STLF,"

  - title: "Frequency-Domain Decomposition and Deep Learning Based Solar PV Power Ultra-Short-Term Forecasting Model"
    excerpt: "Ultra-short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting can support the real-time dispatching of power grid. However, PV power has great fluctuations due to various meteorological factors, which increases energy prices and cause difficulties in managing the grid."
