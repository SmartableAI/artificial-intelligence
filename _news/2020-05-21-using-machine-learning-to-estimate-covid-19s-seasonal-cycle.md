title: "Using machine learning to estimate COVID-19’s seasonal cycle"
excerpt: "One of the many unanswered scientific questions about COVID-19 is whether it is seasonal like the flu — waning in warm summer months then resurging in the fall and winter. Now scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) are launching a project to apply machine-learning methods to a plethora of health and environmental datasets,"
