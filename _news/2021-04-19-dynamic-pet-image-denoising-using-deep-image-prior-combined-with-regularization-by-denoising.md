title: "Dynamic PET Image Denoising Using Deep Image Prior Combined With Regularization by Denoising"
excerpt: "The quantitative accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) is affected by several factors, including the intrinsic resolution of the imaging system and inherently noisy data, which result in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of PET image."

  - title: "Deep learning early stopping for non-degenerate ghost imaging"
    excerpt: "Quantum ghost imaging offers many advantages over classical imaging, including the ability to probe an object with one wavelength and record the image with another (non-degenerate ghost imaging), but suffers from slow image reconstruction due to sparsity and probabilistic arrival positions of photons."

  - title: "Real-Time Error Detection in Nonlinear Control Systems Using Machine Learning Assisted State-Space Encoding"
    excerpt: "Successful deployment of autonomous systems in a wide range of societal applications depends on error-free operation of the underlying signal processing and control functions. Real-time error detection in nonlinear systems has mostly relied on redundancy at the component or algorithmic level causing expensive area and power overheads."
