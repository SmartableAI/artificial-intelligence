    excerpt: "Google Brain research scientist Quoc Le has released a new milestone for ImageNet, a database used in visual object recognition. Image recognition technology has been paramount to the success of Artificial Intelligence (AI). A new semi-supervised learning method will allow an increase in the accuracy of the model to 90.2%, up 1.6% from previous limits. 3  Image recognition technology continues to improve, pushing the boundaries of AI. For example, facial recognition has come to serve a new purpose within the “new normal” of face coverings amid the pandemic. Advanced facial recognition for people wearing masks has been developed at Japanese biometrics firm NEC Corporation with 99.9% accuracy. 4  The technology allows safe entry and exit systems for companies, educational institutions, public facilities, commercial facilities, event venues and theme parks. Activision Blizzard’s franchise, Call of Duty, continues to show strong engagement even as we re-open our economies. Combined monthly active users (MAU) during December 2020 on Modern Warfare/Warzone and Black Ops Cold War totaled 66 million people across PC, console, and mobile. 8  The figure easily exceeds the second closest video game, Minecraft, with a total MAU of 39 million. These numbers show that video game engagement remains at elevated levels, even beyond the stay-at-home economy experienced earlier in 2020. With new video game consoles continuing to hit the market, momentum may continue in 2021. Mental health is one area of medicine quickly transitioning to virtual care. In the stages before the pandemic, telepsychiatry was gaining traction but only adopted by a relatively small group of people. The trend is accelerating rapidly, however, with the American Psychiatric Association reported members utilizing tele-psych soared to 84.7% from just 2.1% prior to Covid-19. 9  Although largely the result of unique circumstances, this transition has shown patients and providers the added benefits such as convenience, time, and costs, as well as and continual therapist-patient relationships. Global X has developed an interactive, self-guided Intro to Thematic Investing course, that is designed to share the latest ideas and best practices for incorporating thematic investing into a portfolio."
