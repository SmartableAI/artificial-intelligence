title: "Glove translates sign language in real-time - '99 percent recognition rate'"
excerpt: "The cutting-edge glove features thin, stretchable sensors running to the fingertips. These sensors can detect motions and finger placement through electrically conducting yarns. Our hope is that this opens up an easy way for people who use sign language to communicate directly with non-signers Those sensors are then connected to a tiny circuit board â€“ approximately the size of a coin worn on users' wrists."
