  - title: "Researchers build first AI tool capable of identifying individual birds"
    excerpt: "New research demonstrates for the first time that artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to train computers to recognize individual birds, a task humans are unable to do. The research is published in the British Ecological Society journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution."

  - title: "AI software which recognises individual birds could boost conservation efforts, researchers say"
    excerpt: "Birds could be spared the stressful process of identification tagging after researchers developed facial recognition software which can recognise individual birds, something humans are unable to do.|  Individual recognition of animals is one of the most expensive and time-consuming problems in research,"
