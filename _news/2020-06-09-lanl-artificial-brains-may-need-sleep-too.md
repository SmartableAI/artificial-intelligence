title: "LANL: Artificial Brains May Need Sleep, Too"
excerpt: "We study spiking neural networks, which are systems that learn much as living brains do,” LANL computer scientist Yijing Watkins said. “We were fascinated by the prospect of training a neuromorphic processor in a manner analogous to how humans and other biological systems learn from their environment during childhood development."

    excerpt: "Neural networks that become unstable after continuous periods of self-learning will return to stability after exposed to sleep like states, according to a study of simulated spiking neural networks, suggesting that even artificial brains need to nap occasionally."
