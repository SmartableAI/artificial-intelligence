title: "Predicting adverse outcomes due to diabetes complications with machine learning using administrative health data"
excerpt: "Across jurisdictions, government and health insurance providers hold a large amount of data from patient interactions with the healthcare system. We aimed to develop a machine learning-based model for predicting adverse outcomes due to diabetes complications using administrative health data from the single-payer health system in Ontario,"

  - title: "RNA secondary structure prediction using deep learning with thermodynamic integration"
    excerpt: "Accurately predicting the secondary structure of non-coding RNAs can help unravel their function. Here the authors propose a method integrating thermodynamic information and deep learning to improve the robustness of RNA secondary structure prediction compared to several existing algorithms."

  - title: "StressNet - Deep learning to predict stress with fracture propagation in brittle materials"
    excerpt: "Catastrophic failure in brittle materials is often due to the rapid growth and coalescence of cracks aided by high internal stresses. Hence, accurate prediction of maximum internal stress is critical to predicting time to failure and improving the fracture resistance and reliability of materials."
