title: "Here come the self-driving trucks: GMC Sierra goes hands-free"
excerpt: "Self-driving technology is coming to a pickup truck near you. GMC says it will offer its hands-free driver-assistance feature Super Cruise on its Sierra pickup sometime in 2022. While the Sierra will not be the first GMC product to option the award-winning technology — that honor will go to the Hummer EV in 2021 — the Sierra is by far the highest-volume GM product to receive the technology thus far."
