title: "Genome-wide investigation of gene-cancer associations for the prediction of novel therapeutic targets in oncology"
excerpt: "In the genomics era, the availability of large biomedical datasets with genome-wide readouts has the potential to transform target selection and validation. In this study we investigate how computational intelligence methods can be applied to predict novel therapeutic targets in oncology."
