title: "Opinion: should you be able to control a car with your voice?"
excerpt: "I drove a Saab prototype without a steering wheel. Not an autonomous car, note. I said “I drove”. The idea was that in a crash you wouldn’t biff into the steering wheel and column. Instead you had a joystick down where the gearstick normally was."
