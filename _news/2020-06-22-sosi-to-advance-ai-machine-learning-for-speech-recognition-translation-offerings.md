    excerpt: "The authors present a model to parse and recognise syllables on-line in natural speech sentences that combine predictive coding and neural oscillations. They use simulations from different versions of the model to establish the importance of both theta-gamma coupling and the reset of accumulated evidence in continuous speech processing."
