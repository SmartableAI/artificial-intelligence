title: "Study: Machine learning can help detect cancer cells by their acidity"
excerpt: "Cancer cells have a different level of acidity than healthy cells, causing them to react differently to pH-sensitive dye that changes color based on a cell's acidity. Researchers then used machine learning to map color combinations to classify the disease state of individual cells."
