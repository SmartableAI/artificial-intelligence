title: "RNA secondary structure prediction using deep learning with thermodynamic integration"
excerpt: "Accurately predicting the secondary structure of non-coding RNAs can help unravel their function. Here the authors propose a method integrating thermodynamic information and deep learning to improve the robustness of RNA secondary structure prediction compared to several existing algorithms."

  - title: "StressNet - Deep learning to predict stress with fracture propagation in brittle materials"
    excerpt: "Catastrophic failure in brittle materials is often due to the rapid growth and coalescence of cracks aided by high internal stresses. Hence, accurate prediction of maximum internal stress is critical to predicting time to failure and improving the fracture resistance and reliability of materials."
