title: "MIT’s tiny artificial brain chip could bring supercomputer smarts to mobile devices"
excerpt: "Researchers at MIT have published a new paper that describes a new type of artificial brain synapse which offers performance improvements vs. other exiting versions, and which can be combined in volumes of tens of thousands on a chip that’s smaller physically than a single piece of confetti."

    excerpt: "MIT engineers have designed a 'brain-on-a-chip,' smaller than a piece of confetti, that is made from tens of thousands of artificial brain synapses known as memristors -- silicon-based components that mimic the information-transmitting synapses in the human brain."
