title: "Researchers believe artificial brains may also need to ‘sleep’"
excerpt: "Attempts to build neural networks similar in capacity to the human brain have found that periods of sleep help quell instability. Researchers’ efforts to build artificial brains using powerful neural networks have discovered a potential mirroring of humanity in their systems. A team from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US led by ..."

    excerpt: "Neural networks that become unstable after continuous periods of self-learning will return to stability after exposed to sleep like states, according to a study of simulated spiking neural networks, suggesting that even artificial brains need to nap occasionally."
