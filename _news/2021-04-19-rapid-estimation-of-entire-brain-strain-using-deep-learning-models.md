title: "Rapid Estimation of Entire Brain Strain Using Deep Learning Models"
excerpt: "Objective: Many recent studies have suggested that brain deformation resulting from a head impact is linked to the corresponding clinical outcome, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Even though several finite element (FE) head models have been developed and validated to calculate brain deformation based on impact kinematics,"

    excerpt: "Machine learning algorithms help to deeply analyses and monitor the minor changes in the objects. In the medical image, a little doubtful value also creates a big transformation in the outcome, which will be sorted out using learning-based algorithms."
