title: "Engineers put tens of thousands of artificial brain synapses on a single chip"
excerpt: "MIT engineers have designed a 'brain-on-a-chip,' smaller than a piece of confetti, that is made from tens of thousands of artificial brain synapses known as memristors -- silicon-based components that mimic the information-transmitting synapses in the human brain."
