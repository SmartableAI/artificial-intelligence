  - title: "Researchers present self-learning algorithms for a large number of different imaging datasets"
    excerpt: "AI-based evaluation of medical imaging data usually requires a specially developed algorithm for each task. Scientists from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) have now presented a new method for configuring self-learning algorithms for a large number of different imaging datasetsâ€”without the need for specialist knowledge or very significant computing power."
