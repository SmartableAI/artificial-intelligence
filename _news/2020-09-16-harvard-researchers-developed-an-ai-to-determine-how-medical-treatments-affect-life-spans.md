title: "Harvard researchers developed an AI to determine how medical treatments affect life spans"
excerpt: "It was created by researchers from Harvard Medical School’s Sinclair Lab, who say it’s the first study to track a mouse’s frailty for the duration of its life. They plan to use the predictions to quickly test interventions intended to extend the mice’s lives and move towards doing the same in humans."
