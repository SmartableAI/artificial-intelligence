title: "Engineers Put Tens of Thousands of Artificial Brain Synapses on a Single Chip for Portable AI Devices"
excerpt: "MIT engineers have designed a “brain-on-a-chip,” smaller than a piece of confetti, that is made from tens of thousands of artificial brain synapses known as memristors — silicon-based components that mimic the information-transmitting synapses in the human brain."
