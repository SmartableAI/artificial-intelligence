title: "Moving from notebooks to automated ML pipelines using Amazon SageMaker and AWS Glue"
excerpt: "A typical machine learning (ML) workflow involves processes such as data extraction, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and model deployment. As data changes over time, when you deploy models to production, you want your model to learn continually from the stream"
