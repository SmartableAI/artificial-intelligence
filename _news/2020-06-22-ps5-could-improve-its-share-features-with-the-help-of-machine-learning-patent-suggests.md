title: "PS5 Could Improve Its Share Features With the Help of Machine Learning, Patent Suggests"
excerpt: "The easier it is for players to share their gameplay footage, the more data you—or, perhaps more importantly, a platform holder—will need in order to sort through it all. To that end, a new Sony patent filing suggests that the company's working on a machine-learning assisted player ID system to help sort and surface players' gameplay footage."
