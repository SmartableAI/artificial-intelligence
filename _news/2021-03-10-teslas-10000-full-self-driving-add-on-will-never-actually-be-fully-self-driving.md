title: "Tesla’s $10,000 ‘Full Self-Driving’ Add-On Will Never Actually Be Fully Self-Driving"
excerpt: "Tesla rolled out a beta version of its new Autopilot Full Self-Driving (FSD) software (version 8.2) to a small group of Tesla owners in the United States. Driven by high-than-expected demand, this past weekend Elon Musk said his company would make the driver-assistance system available to more customers."
