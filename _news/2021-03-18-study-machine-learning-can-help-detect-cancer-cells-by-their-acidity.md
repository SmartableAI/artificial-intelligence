title: "Study: Machine learning can help detect cancer cells by their acidity"
excerpt: "Cancer cells have a different level of acidity than healthy cells, causing them to react differently to pH-sensitive dye that changes color based on a cell's acidity. Researchers then used machine learning to map color combinations to classify the disease state of individual cells."

  - title: "AI-based technique determines cancer cells by their acidity"
    excerpt: "Healthy and cancer cells can look similar under a microscope. One way of differentiating them is by examining the level of acidity, or pH level, inside the cells."

  - title: "Machine learning approach can identify cancerous single cells by detecting its pH"
    excerpt: "Cancerous cells exhibit several key differences from healthy cells that help identify them as dangerous. For instance, the pH -- the level of acidity -- within a cancerous cell is not the same as the pH within a healthy cell."
