title: "Artificial Intelligence: Learning to Learn from Less"
excerpt: "But alternatives to massive machine learning algorithms are beginning to be explored. Two promising AI techniques are ‘few-shot’ and ‘one-shot’ AI. These algorithms are able to train on a particular task and then use the information they’ve learned from that task and then apply it to other similar tasks or new examples."
