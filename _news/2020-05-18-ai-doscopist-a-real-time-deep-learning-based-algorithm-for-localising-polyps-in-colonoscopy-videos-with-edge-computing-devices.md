title: "AI-doscopist: a real-time deep-learning-based algorithm for localising polyps in colonoscopy videos with edge computing devices"
excerpt: "AI-doscopist was pre-trained by 1.2 million non-medical images and fine-tuned by 291,090 colonoscopy and non-medical images. The colonoscopy images were obtained from six databases, where the colonoscopy images were classified into 13 categories and the polypsâ€™ locations were marked image-by-image by the smallest bounding boxes."
