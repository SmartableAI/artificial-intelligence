title: "DeepONet: A deep neural network-based model to approximate linear and nonlinear operators"
excerpt: "Artificial neural networks are known to be highly efficient approximators of continuous functions, which are functions with no sudden changes in values (i.e., discontinuities, holes or jumps in graph representations). While many studies have explored the ..."
