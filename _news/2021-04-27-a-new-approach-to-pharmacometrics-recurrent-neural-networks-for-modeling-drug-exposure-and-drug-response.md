title: "A New Approach to Pharmacometrics: Recurrent Neural Networks for Modeling Drug Exposure and Drug Response"
excerpt: "CDER researchers have recently investigated how methods that use artificial neural networks (some basic elements of these are shown in Figure 1) can be applied to modeling problems.1 Specifically, CDER scientists have developed a model based on a kind of ..."
