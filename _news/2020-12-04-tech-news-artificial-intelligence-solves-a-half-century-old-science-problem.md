title: "Tech News: Artificial Intelligence solves a half-century-old science problem"
excerpt: "Solving a complex biological problem Proteins are large complex molecules, made up of chains of amino acids. Scientists have been struggling for almost half a century with the problem of “protein folding” – the mapping of the three-dimensional shapes of the proteins that are responsible for diseases from cancer to Covid-19."
