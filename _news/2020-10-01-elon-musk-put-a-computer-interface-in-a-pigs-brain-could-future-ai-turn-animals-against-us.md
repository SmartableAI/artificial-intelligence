title: "Elon Musk put a computer interface in a pig’s brain. Could future AI turn animals against us?"
excerpt: "It’s been a month since Elon Musk and Neuralink trotted out a cyborg pig to show off the company’s progress toward a brain computer interface (BCI). I still see Gertrude in my nightmares. The big idea behind Neuralink is the development of a brain implant that will allow everybody to control computers with their minds."
