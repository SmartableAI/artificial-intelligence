  - title: "StressNet - Deep learning to predict stress with fracture propagation in brittle materials"
    excerpt: "Catastrophic failure in brittle materials is often due to the rapid growth and coalescence of cracks aided by high internal stresses. Hence, accurate prediction of maximum internal stress is critical to predicting time to failure and improving the fracture resistance and reliability of materials."
