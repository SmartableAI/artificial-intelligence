title: "Artificial intelligence that mimics the brain needs sleep just like humans, study reveals"
excerpt: "Artificial intelligence designed to function like a human could require periods of rest similar to those needed by biological brains. Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US discovered that neural networks experienced benefits that were \"the equivalent of a good night's rest\" when exposed to an artificial analogue of sleep."

  - title: "Researchers believe artificial brains may also need to ‘sleep’"
    excerpt: "Attempts to build neural networks similar in capacity to the human brain have found that periods of sleep help quell instability. Researchers’ efforts to build artificial brains using powerful neural networks have discovered a potential mirroring of humanity in their systems. A team from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US led by ..."
