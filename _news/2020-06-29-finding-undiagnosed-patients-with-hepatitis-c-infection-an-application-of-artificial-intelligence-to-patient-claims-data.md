title: "Finding undiagnosed patients with hepatitis C infection: an application of artificial intelligence to patient claims data"
excerpt: "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a significant public health challenge with approximately half of the infected population untreated and undiagnosed. In this retrospective study, predictive models were developed to identify undiagnosed HCV patients using longitudinal medical claims linked to prescription data from approximately ten million patients in the United States (US) between 2010 and 2016."
