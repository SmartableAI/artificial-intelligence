title: "Fujitsu develops facial detection AI to quantify concentration levels of people"
excerpt: "Fujitsu has developed a new AI model that it claims can capture and quantify how much a person is concentrating when performing tasks. Conventionally, AI models that are designed to quantify concentration have been created by training algorithms to recognise the expressions and behaviours of people performing specific tasks,"
