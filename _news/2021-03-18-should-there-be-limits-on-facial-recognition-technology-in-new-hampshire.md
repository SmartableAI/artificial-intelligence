title: "Should there be limits on facial recognition technology in New Hampshire?"
excerpt: "The same technology that allows you to open your phone simply by looking at it can be used by governments to track people as they go about their lives in public. There’s a New Hampshire bill up for debate this year — House Bill 499 — to set limits on how this kind of technology can be used in the Granite State."
