title: "Molecular function recognition by supervised projection pursuit machine learning"
excerpt: "Identifying mechanisms that control molecular function is a significant challenge in pharmaceutical science and molecular engineering. Here, we present a novel projection pursuit recurrent neural network to identify functional mechanisms in the context of iterative supervised machine learning for discovery-based design optimization."
