title: "Predictive learning as a network mechanism for extracting low-dimensional latent space representations"
excerpt: "Neural networks trained using predictive models generate representations that recover the underlying low-dimensional latent structure in the data. Here, the authors demonstrate that a network trained on a spatial navigation task generates place-related neural activations similar to those observed in the hippocampus and show that these are related to the latent structure."

  - title: "High-dimensional hepatopath data analysis by machine learning for predicting HBV-related fibrosis"
    excerpt: "Machine learning algorithms are particularly adept at analyzing medical phenomenon by capturing complex and nonlinear relationships in clinical data. Our study proposed a predictive model on the basis of 55 routine laboratory and clinical parameters by machine learning algorithms as a novel non-invasive method for liver fibrosis diagnosis."
