title: "Explaining Amazon SageMaker Autopilot models with SHAP"
excerpt: "Machine learning (ML) models have long been considered black boxes because predictions from these models are hard to interpret. However, recently, several frameworks aiming at explaining ML models were proposed. Model interpretation can be divided into local and global explanations. A local explanation"
